# ScreenTime Widget for Windows

A clean, minimalist desktop widget that tracks and displays your daily screen time and most-used applications, built with Wails, Go, React, and TypeScript.

## Features

- **Real-time Tracking**: Monitors active applications every second
- **Clean UI**: Frameless, translucent widget that stays on top
- **Daily Statistics**: Shows total screen time and top 4 most-used apps
- **Lightweight**: Minimal CPU and memory footprint
- **Draggable**: Move the widget anywhere on your desktop
- **Auto-refresh**: Updates every 5 seconds

## Architecture Principles

### Backend (Go)

- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation between app, services, and platform layers
- **Dependency Injection**: Services are injected into the app layer
- **Interface Segregation**: Platform-specific code is abstracted behind interfaces
- **Single Responsibility**: Each package has a single, well-defined purpose

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)

- **Component-Based**: UI is broken down into reusable components
- **Custom Hooks**: Business logic is extracted into custom hooks
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper type definitions
- **Separation of Concerns**: Components, hooks, utils, and constants are separated

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.23 or later
- Node.js 16 or later
- Wails CLI v2

### Development

```bash
# Install Wails CLI
go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/cmd/wails@latest

# Run in development mode
wails dev
```

### Production Build

```bash
# Build for Windows
wails build

# Build with clean
wails build -clean
```

## Usage

1. Run the executable (`qwin.exe`)
2. The widget will appear as a small, translucent window
3. Drag it to your preferred position on the desktop
4. The widget will automatically track your application usage
5. Click the minimize button to minimize to system tray
6. Click the X button to close the application

## Technical Details

- **Windows API Integration**: Uses Windows API calls to track active windows
- **Thread-Safe**: Concurrent access to usage data is properly synchronized
- **Memory Efficient**: In-memory storage with minimal overhead
- **Real-time Updates**: Frontend polls backend every 5 seconds for updates
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and error states

## Future Enhancements

### Core Features

- [ ] Data persistence across application restarts
- [ ] Weekly/monthly usage reports
- [ ] Application time limits and notifications
- [ ] Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux)
- [ ] System tray integration
- [ ] Usage export functionality

### Production Database Migration Enhancements

- [ ] **Database backup before migration**: Automatically create database backups before applying schema changes during app updates
- [ ] **Backup retention policy**: Retain last 3 versions or 30 days, whichever is longer
- [ ] **Recovery time objectives**: Set RPO = 0, RTO ≤ 30s on typical user machines
- [ ] **Operational requirements**: Lock DB file during migration and present a non-cancellable progress UI
- [ ] **Migration failure recovery**: Implement rollback mechanism to restore from backup if migration fails
- [ ] **User feedback during migration**: Show progress dialog to inform users when database schema is being updated
- [ ] **Migration validation**: Test migrations on a database copy before applying to production data
- [ ] **Graceful degradation**: Allow app to run in compatibility mode if migration fails, rather than preventing startup
- [ ] **Update notification system**: Integrate with separate updater app to handle coordinated updates and migrations
